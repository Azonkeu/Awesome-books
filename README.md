# Awesome-books

## Awesome books: plain JavaScript with objects

In this project, we will build a basic website that allows users to add and remove books from a list. We will achieve that by using JavaScript objects and arrays. We will also need to dynamically modify the DOM and add basic events.

### Project requirements

* Create a Github repository.
* Set up the repository locally by cloning it to your local machine.
* Create a feature branch.
* Configure the upstream remote value.
* Make sure that there are [no linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config).
* Make sure that you used correct [GitHub Flow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/github_flow.md).
* Make sure that you documented your work [in a professional way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md).
* Create a collection that keeps a list of books (hint: you can use an array of objects for that).
* Create a function to add a new book to the collection, with title and author.
* Create a function to remove a book from the collection (hint: you can use the array filter() method).
* Display all books saved in the collection in the top part of the page.
* Make sure that when a user clicks the "Add" button:
     * A new book is added to the collection.
     * The new book is displayed in the page.
